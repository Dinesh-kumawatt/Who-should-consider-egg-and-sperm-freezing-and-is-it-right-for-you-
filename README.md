Egg and sperm freezing, also known as fertility preservation, is a valuable option for individuals who wish to delay parenthood or face medical conditions affecting fertility. Egg freezing is typically considered by women who want to preserve their reproductive potential before age-related decline or prior to medical treatments like chemotherapy that may impact ovarian reserve. Sperm freezing is useful for men facing surgeries, medical treatments, or lifestyle factors that could reduce fertility, or those planning to delay fatherhood. The process involves retrieval of eggs or sperm, followed by controlled freezing using vitrification or cryopreservation techniques to maintain viability for future use. Not everyone needs fertility preservation, but it is particularly recommended for individuals with a family history of early menopause, low ovarian reserve, chronic illnesses, or exposure to environmental or occupational risks. Counseling with a fertility specialist is essential to discuss timing, procedure risks, success rates, and future IVF use. While freezing provides hope for future conception, it does not guarantee pregnancy, making informed decisions crucial. Ultimately, fertility preservation empowers individuals with reproductive choices and flexibility, allowing them to plan parenthood on their own terms.
